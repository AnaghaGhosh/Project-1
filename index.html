You will be able to mark them as complete and the amount of work remaining can be tracked at any point in time. The percentage progress is also displayed. Editing all these details, as many times as you require, is quite simple. There are features to search and display information from your schedule. To sum it up, this Schedule Manager will do what is necessary to help you plan.</b></p>
